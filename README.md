# ME-446-Milestone5

An acrobot (underactuated 2-link manipulator) is programmed in MATLAB to be able to throw a ball at a desired location.

The procedure to run the code is, 

1. First run 'optim_main.m', this performs trajectory optimization and creates
	a. An animation for the discretized system
	b. Plots of the error due to discretization

2. Run 'MAIN.m', this uses the solution generated earlier to create,
	a. An animation on the real system
	b. Plot of motor constraint
	c. Plots of tracking of the real system
	d. Outputs the energy and power consumed during the maneuver

The edited code for all the cases (in individual branches) mentioned in the report can be found on,
